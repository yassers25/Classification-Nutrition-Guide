## Introduction üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ

**Agricultural Products Analysis Platform** is a robust web application designed using **Streamlit**, focusing on two core functionalities: **classification** and **object detection** of agricultural products. Whether you are a researcher, a dietitian, or just someone passionate about healthy eating, this platform provides useful tools to help you classify fruits and vegetables, as well as understand their nutritional values in depth.

With built-in support for **YOLO object detection** (You Only Look Once), this tool can detect and classify agricultural products from both images and videos in real-time.

## Features ‚ú®

### Classification & Nutrition Guide ü•¶üçì
This feature leverages powerful deep learning models like **VGG16**, **ResNet**, and **EfficientNet** to classify agricultural products. Once the product is classified, the platform provides the following benefits:
- **Accurate Classification**: The tool identifies the agricultural product, from fruits to vegetables, ensuring precise results.
- **Detailed Nutritional Information**: After classification, users can view a comprehensive nutritional profile, which includes important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
- **Healthy Eating Recommendations**: Based on the classification, users can receive recommendations for healthy consumption and a balanced diet.

### Object Detection (YOLO) üçèüçä
Powered by **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, the **Object Detection** feature allows the platform to detect and locate fruits and vegetables in images or videos. This real-time detection feature offers:
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Upload images or videos, and the platform will detect and highlight agricultural products instantly.
- **Supports Images & Videos**: It works with both static images and dynamic video files, allowing for a versatile analysis of agricultural products.
- **Fast Processing**: Thanks to YOLO's advanced architecture, detection results are provided in real-time, ensuring a fast user experience.
