# Agricultural Products Analysis Platform üå±

Welcome to the **Agricultural Products Analysis Platform**! This platform is designed to assist individuals and organizations in analyzing and classifying agricultural products, including fruits and vegetables, through modern machine learning and computer vision technologies. With two primary features, **Classification & Nutrition Guide** and **Object Detection (YOLO)**, users can seamlessly classify agricultural items and retrieve detailed nutritional information or perform object detection on images and videos.

## Introduction üë®‚Äçüåæüë©‚Äçüåæ

**Agricultural Products Analysis Platform** is a robust web application designed using **Streamlit**, focusing on two core functionalities: **classification** and **object detection** of agricultural products. 
With built-in support for **YOLO object detection** (You Only Look Once), this tool can detect and classify agricultural products from both images and videos in real-time.

## Features ‚ú®

### Classification & Nutrition Guide ü•¶üçì
This feature leverages powerful deep learning models like **VGG16**, **ResNet**, and **EfficientNet** to classify agricultural products. Once the product is classified, the platform provides the following benefits:
- **Accurate Classification**: The tool identifies the agricultural product, from fruits to vegetables, ensuring precise results. With an accuracy of **97%**, you can trust the classification results.
- **Detailed Nutritional Information**: After classification, users can view a comprehensive nutritional profile, which includes important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
- **Healthy Eating Recommendations**: Based on the classification, users can receive recommendations for healthy consumption and a balanced diet.

### Object Detection (YOLO) üçèüçä
Powered by **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, the **Object Detection** feature allows the platform to detect and locate fruits and vegetables in images or videos. This real-time detection feature offers:
- **Real-time Object Detection**: Upload images or videos, and the platform will detect and highlight agricultural products instantly.
- **Supports Images & Videos**: It works with both static images and dynamic video files, allowing for a versatile analysis of agricultural products.
- **Fast Processing**: Thanks to YOLO's advanced architecture, detection results are provided in real-time, ensuring a fast user experience.
